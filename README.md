# VGM
This Repo contains the final project of my web dev class which was to create a website with a html/css and use a php/mysql as a database.

VGM is a video game marketplace and library system. You can log in, browse the marketplace, view your library, and leave a review!

obviously not a fully functionally marketplace or libraby just skeletons really. This has been my first real web development task.
I think it came out great. Credit to my parter, Nick Sims for doing 99% of the php and mysql.
